# Design-and-Implementation-of-Dual-Clock-Asynchronous-FIFO
Developed a 64Ã—8 asynchronous FIFO for burst data transfer between different clock domains , achieving clock domain crossing synchronization using a Gray code counter and a two-flop synchronizer, and verified its full and empty conditions by simulating with a 50 MHz write clock and a 10 MHz read clock.
